In general, it would be the closest gForce\nArmband that has the highest RSSI. Therefore, after powering on gForce 100\narmband and gForceJoint, put the gForce 100 Armband as close to the gForceJoint\nas within 5 cm. Successful connection turns the green LED on the gForce Armband\nto flash at a relatively high frequency.\n\n\nTo disconnect, simply \nturn off the gForce 100 Armand\n.\n\n\nConnecting gForceJoint with Target Control System\n\n\ngForceJoint provides GPIO and UART to interface with target control system.\nHowever, UART is recommended.\n\n\nThe following figure shows the IOs of gForceJoint.\n\n\n\n\nVCC is the power supply to the gForceJoint board. gForceJoint is designed to\nsupport 3.3V or 5V power supply.\n\n\n\n\nWhen 5V is used, the jumper should be put to connect 'A2' and 'O1'.\n\n\nWhen 3.3V is used, the jumper should be put to connect 'A1' and 'O1'\n\n\n\n\nThe UART interface has the VCC/GND/TX/RX pins. The TX/RX is named from the\nperspective of gForceJoint board.\n\n\nRelationship between LED Indicators And Gestures\n\n\ngForceJoint has six LED lights to indicate recognized gestures.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The \nPower LED\n will be on when the gForceJoint is powered on, otherwise off.\n\n\nThe following table shows the relationship between LED1...6 and gestures:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n\n\nFist\n\n\nSpread Fingers\n\n\nWave-In\n\n\nWave-Out\n\n\nPinch\n\n\nShoot\n\n\nRelax\n\n\nUnknown gesture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED1\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED2\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED3\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED4\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED5\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED6\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOn\n\n\nOff\n\n\nOff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngForceJoint UART Data Protocol\n\n\ngForceJoint UART adopts a data protocol similar to TLV (type-length-value).\n\n\ngForceJoint UART consists of two types of data transfers:\n\n\n\n\nCommand: data from the Target Control System to gForceJoint.\n\n\nEvent: data from gForceJoint to Target Control System.\n\n\n\n\nRight now, only Event is supported.

Developers can wire the gForceJoint to the UART inteface of the target control\nsystem (e.g an Arduino board, or an Raspberry Pi) so that the target control\nsystem can be controled by the gForce 100 Armband.",

Therefore, after powering on gForce 100\narmband and gForceJoint, put the gForce 100 Armband as close to the gForceJoint\nas within 5 cm. Successful connection turns the green LED on the gForce Armband\nto flash at a relatively high frequency.  To disconnect, simply  turn off the gForce 100 Armand .",
